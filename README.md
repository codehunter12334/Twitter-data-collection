# Twitter-data-collection
It's a project during my studies in master degree where we had to collect data from twitter. We choosed to collect all the data which refers to basketball,
football and volleyball. At the same time we used phpmyadmin as the database where we stored everything for a further analysis. 
In this project I had uploaded only the code for collecting, cleaning and storing the data from twitter to the database
Connection to api of twitter and collect in order to store them in database and provide later an analysis of them.
YOu should use yours database to store the data and change the name of it otherwise it will not work


I hope It will be helpful
